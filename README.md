MinimaMusica
============

Will fetch the data of songs from songs.pk and update the database of musicbrainz.

DONE-

1. Fetched song data from a single page in a dict.

TODO-

1. Make the script to fetch data from all the movies lexicographically.
2. Adopt the schema as given on musicbrainz.
3. Since there is no API or any editable WS - so either make one or make a bot that can mass-edit the releases.

THOUGHTS-

1. Limiting the updating/editing of releases so that community can verify the updates/edits.
